# meditationVR

A VR experience for Google Cardboard on Android made in Unity3D.

Users experience an artistic interpretation of meditation, where objects and significant words float toward the user in a void space. During the experience, the user may find themselves feeling as though they are merely and observer to the events in the meditative space as objects drift through them. However, in time, the user will discover that they are able to interact with the objects, knocking away incoming objects and keeping the path before them clear.

The words were selected based on an article from Livestrong.com on the [Top 10 Causes of Stress](https://www.livestrong.com/article/132015-top-10-causes-stress/).

This project was made for Dr. Natasha Banerjee's Mixed Reality course at Clarkson University.
